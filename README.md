# Flightfare_prediction


This project is a Machine Learning model in python in which we have taken a huge dataset consisting of various factors affecting the fares of flight tickets to predict the fare on some given parameters.

## Features
* Predicts the fare to be given for a particular flight.
* Includes implementation Random forest,Exploratory data analysis and outlier detection

## Performance

* This model acheives an efficiency of about 90%.
